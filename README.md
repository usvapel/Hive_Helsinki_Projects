## Projects

Projects completed at Hive Helsinki. Focusing on C programming, system administration, and graphics.

### Core C Projects

#### [**libft**](https://github.com/usvapel/libft) &nbsp;![Grade: 125](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grade-125/100-brightgreen?style=plastic)
> A custom implementation of key components of the **C** standard library, focusing on memory manipulation functions (such as `memcpy`, `memset`), string handling routines (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`), and various utility functions for character processing and data conversion. This implementation provides core functionality often used in **C** programming.  
**Tech:** C, libc

#### [**ft_printf**](https://github.com/usvapel/ft_printf) &nbsp;![Grade: 100](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grade-100/100-brightgreen?style=plastic)
> Recreation of the `printf` function from scratch, supporting formatted output with variadic arguments.
Handles basic conversion specifiers including `%s` (string), `%d` and `%i` (signed integers), `%c` (character), `%x` and `%X` (hexadecimal), `%p` (pointer), `%u` (unsigned integer), and literal `%%`.  
**Tech:** C, Variadic Functions

#### [**get_next_line**](https://github.com/usvapel/get_next_line) &nbsp;![Grade: 105](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grade-105/100-brightgreen?style=plastic)
> A line-by-line file reader using **static** memory allocation.
Reads from a file descriptor and returns one line at a time, preserving leftover data between calls via a static buffer.
The read buffer size is defined at compile-time via **BUFFER_SIZE**, allowing customizable performance and memory usage trade-offs.  
**Tech:** C, File I/O

### Graphics & Interactivity

[**fract-ol**](https://github.com/usvapel/fract-ol) &nbsp;![Grade: 125](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grade-125/100-brightgreen?style=plastic) ![Outstanding project: 1/3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Outstanding%20project-⭐☆☆-blue?style=plastic)
> A fractal rendering application supporting the **Mandelbrot**, **Julia**, and **Burning Ship** sets, featuring interactive zooming and panning capabilities.
The program includes dynamic color shifting and displays a secondary **Julia** set visualization that updates in real-time based on the cursor position within the primary **Mandelbrot** or **Burning Ship** fractal.  
**Tech:** C, MLX42, Graphics Programming
